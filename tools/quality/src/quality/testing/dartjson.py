"""Test results from the JSON reporter of `package:test` (`dart test --file-reporter json:...`).

The report is one JSON event per line. Suites, test starts and completions, and
errors are read; every other event (`start`, `allSuites`, `group`, `print`,
`debug`) is ignored. A case is named `<suite path>::<test name>`, where the
suite path is relative to the directory `dart test` ran in.

The runner reports its own pseudo-tests, such as `loading <file>` and
`(setUpAll)`, as hidden. A hidden case is dropped only when it passed, so a
suite that fails to load still counts as an error. An `error` event for a test
that already passed makes it an error, because `package:test` reports errors
raised after a test completed that way. A test that started but never
completed is an error too. A report without the final `done` event, a line that
is not a JSON object, a completion for an unknown or already completed test, or
an event with missing fields is a ReportError: the run's evidence is invalid.

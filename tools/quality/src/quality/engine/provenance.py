"""Validator provenance: a candidate is judged by its own core (decision 0004).

The launcher runs the core from the working tree. Before a verdict command
decides anything, the core compares the files that decide verdicts, its package,
its toolchain manifest, the sources and manifest of the TypeScript helper it
runs on Node, and the sources, manifest, and lockfile of the Dart helper it
compiles, with the candidate's. When they differ, the candidate's core is
materialized and runs the same command as a child process, so unstaged edits to
the validator do not change the verdict. The helpers' installed `node_modules`
and `.dart_tool` do not judge: the TypeScript helper imports TypeScript and
ESLint from the checked component, and the Dart helper is compiled from its
judged files and locked packages. The comparison itself runs from the working
tree; CI runs the committed core and is the boundary for edits to this step.

"""Loopback-only networking for unit suites (R06.9, decision 0008).

Unit tests may use loopback for instrumentation, such as the Dart VM service,
and no other network. `isolated` puts a stub on the core interpreter in front
of a command. The stub enters a new user and network namespace, maps the
caller's own user and group into it, brings the loopback interface up, and
replaces itself with the command. The command keeps the stub's process, so
timeouts and reaping work unchanged; it runs as the caller, without
capabilities, in a namespace whose only interface is loopback, so every other
address is unreachable. The stub runs with `-I`, so a module planted in the
snapshot's working directory is never imported.

Unprivileged user namespaces can be turned off, for example by Ubuntu's
AppArmor restriction. `unavailable` probes the stub once per process and says
why it cannot isolate; `contained` then leaves the command as it is and returns
that reason, which the engine reports as a warning instead of failing the gate
on such a machine.

"""package:test with VM coverage, formatted by the component's package:coverage (decision 0012).

Unit suites run `dart test --platform vm --branch-coverage --coverage=<raw>`
over the suite's roots and one generated test. The generated test is written
only in the snapshot, as `all_libraries_test.dart` in a new directory below the
component's `.dart_tool/quality`, where `package:` imports resolve as in the
component's own tests; snapshots never hold `.dart_tool`, so it cannot collide
with a candidate file. It imports every library of the source roots, each under
its own prefix, and declares no test. The VM compiles every loaded library, so
a file no test imports is reported with zero hits. Part files belong to their
library and are not imported; the helper tells them apart.

The component's locked package:coverage then formats the raw data with
`format_coverage --lcov`, `--report-on` naming each source root, so `bin/`
scripts are measured as well as `lib/`. `--check-ignore` is not passed, so
`coverage:ignore` comments have no effect.

After a clean unit run, a source file that the report lacks was compiled
through the generated test, directly or as a part of an imported library, and
has no coverable line: Dart reports only function entries, calls, and block
entries (decision 0005). `coverage()` adds such a file as measured with no
lines and no branches, which the engine treats as not applicable, like a
TypeScript declaration file. A file the generated test did not reach, such as
a part that no library names, stays missing and fails.

Other suites run `dart test --platform vm` over their roots without coverage.
Every run writes the JSON reporter's events to a results file; a run that
writes none could not run at all. Roots are passed as `./<root>`, so none can
be read as an option and the suite paths in the report stay relative. A
missing root is a failing load case, and a run without tests exits 79 with a
report without cases, which the engine reports as `tests.none`. Each run gets a
new home, cache, and temporary directory, as for Python, and is reaped when it
exits, so no VM service outlives it. A unit suite reaches loopback only where
the system allows it (decision 0008); the VM service needs nothing else.

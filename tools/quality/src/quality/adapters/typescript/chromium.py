"""The pinned Chromium of browser components: installed, started, and matched to Playwright.

Bootstrap installs the Chrome for Testing headless shell of `toolchains.toml`
into the quality cache, never into Playwright's own cache, and doctor locates
it without downloading (decision 0017). Both then prove that it starts on this
machine: `ldd` names the Linux libraries the dynamic loader cannot find, and
`--version` reports the version that ran. The `browsers.json` of the
playwright-core that the component's locked `@playwright/test` loads must
expect that version, or its scenarios would drive a browser that Playwright
release was not made for.

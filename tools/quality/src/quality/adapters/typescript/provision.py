"""What `bootstrap` downloads for a TypeScript component and what `doctor` probes offline.

Bootstrap installs the pinned Node, then runs the component's `npm ci` once with
network access in a throwaway copy of the package manifests, which fills the
shared npm cache. Only the lockfile and the package.json files of the root and
its workspace members are copied: the project's `.npmrc` is not, so the install
uses the public registry and no credentials. Doctor locates Node without
downloading it and repeats the install offline (decision 0010). For a browser
component, bootstrap also installs the pinned Chromium and doctor locates it;
both check that it starts and that the installed Playwright expects it, then
report that this build cannot check the component yet.

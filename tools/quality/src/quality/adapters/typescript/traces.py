"""Console errors, page errors, and missing files of browser tests (decision 0018).

Each test's Playwright trace is a zip of JSON-lines files. The browser
contexts' events hold every console message and every uncaught page error;
Chromium also logs each response with an error status as a console error
`Failed to load resource: ...` without arguments, located at the resource's
URL. Those are not console errors of the application: a request the gate's
server could not answer is reported from the server's own record as
`typescript.browser-resource`, attributed to each test whose trace shows it,
and a response a test fulfills itself, such as a simulated backend error, is
the test's business. Every other console error and every page error is a
`typescript.browser-console` error. Messages lose the gate server's origin,
whose port changes from run to run, so an exception can name them exactly.

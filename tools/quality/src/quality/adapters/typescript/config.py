"""The native configuration of a TypeScript component, checked before its tools run.

Prettier, ESLint, the compiler, and Vitest read their settings from files the
candidate controls, and they import the component's own packages. The profile
requires the files that make those runs reproducible: package.json, a lockfile
that locks the pinned tools, tsconfig.json, and an ESLint flat configuration at
the component root. Legacy `.eslintrc*` files are rejected because ESLint 10
ignores them, so they could only mislead a reader (decision 0011).

JavaScript among the source and test files is reported with the static gates,
which receive the inventory's file list; the check fails either way.

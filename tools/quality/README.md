# Quality core

The `quality` command-line tool decides whether a candidate change passes.
Git hooks and CI only call it. This directory holds its typed Python source,
its tests, the stdlib launcher, and locked development tooling.

<!-- maintainer-only:begin -->

In the template's own repository, `tests/acceptance` holds the maintainer
acceptance harness: real commits and pushes through the managed hooks in
scratch repositories, and the template lifecycle from export to a
four-language project. The export leaves it out
([decision 0016](../../docs/decisions/0016-template-lifecycle.md)).

<!-- maintainer-only:end -->

Packages depend only on lower layers, as described in
[decision 0003](../../docs/decisions/0003-architecture.md); the layer order is
declared in the root `quality.toml` and enforced by `quality check`. The gates
themselves are described in
[decision 0007](../../docs/decisions/0007-common-gates.md), and the test and
coverage engine in
[decision 0008](../../docs/decisions/0008-test-and-coverage-engine.md). The Python profile is
[decision 0009](../../docs/decisions/0009-python-profile.md), the TypeScript profile
[decision 0011](../../docs/decisions/0011-typescript-profile.md), the Dart profile
[decision 0012](../../docs/decisions/0012-dart-profile.md), the PHP profile
[decision 0013](../../docs/decisions/0013-php-profile.md), behavioral scenarios
[decision 0014](../../docs/decisions/0014-behavioral-scenarios.md), the CI wrappers and merge gates
[decision 0015](../../docs/decisions/0015-ci-wrappers-and-merge-gates.md), the template
lifecycle [decision 0016](../../docs/decisions/0016-template-lifecycle.md), and the launcher,
bootstrap, doctor, and hooks are
[decision 0010](../../docs/decisions/0010-launcher-bootstrap-and-hooks.md).

## Native development commands

Day to day, use the gate itself from the repository root:
`./quality self-test` runs the unit suites with coverage. The tool versions
are locked in `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock`
([decision 0001](../../docs/decisions/0001-toolchain-pins.md)); after
`./quality bootstrap`, the native commands run from this directory:

```sh
.venv/bin/ruff format --check src tests
.venv/bin/ruff check src tests
.venv/bin/pyright
PYTHONPATH=src .venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/unit --cov=src --cov-branch
```

pytest runs the core's suites on one pytest-xdist worker per CPU, as set in
`pyproject.toml`; add `-n 0` to run them in one process, for example under a
debugger. Any worker may run any test, so each test sets up its own state;
a module fixture may run once per worker.

<!-- maintainer-only:begin -->

In the template's own repository, `./quality self-test --level acceptance`
runs the maintainer acceptance harness; natively, it is
`PYTHONPATH=src .venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/acceptance` from this
directory. The acceptance tests compare the hook output exactly, so they
expect the network isolation of test suites: where unprivileged user
namespaces are unavailable, the extra `tests.network` warning fails them
([decision 0008](../../docs/decisions/0008-test-and-coverage-engine.md#network-isolation)).

<!-- maintainer-only:end -->

The TypeScript helper runs on the pinned Node. `./quality bootstrap` caches
the packages of its `package-lock.json`, and `npm ci --offline` installs them
into `node_modules`. The native commands run from `helpers/typescript` with
that Node first on `PATH` (`~/.cache/quality/toolchains/node-24.22.0/bin` by
default):

```sh
npm ci --offline --ignore-scripts
node_modules/.bin/prettier --check src tests eslint.config.js vitest.config.ts
node_modules/.bin/eslint src tests
node_modules/.bin/tsc -p .
node_modules/.bin/vitest run --coverage --coverage.include=src --coverage.reporter=text-summary
```

The Dart helper runs on the pinned SDK. `./quality bootstrap` caches the
packages of its `pubspec.lock` in `~/.cache/quality/pub` and compiles it. The
native commands run from `helpers/dart` with
`~/.cache/quality/toolchains/dart-3.13.6/bin` first on `PATH` and
`PUB_CACHE=~/.cache/quality/pub`:

```sh
dart pub get --offline --enforce-lockfile
dart format --output=none --set-exit-if-changed bin lib test
dart analyze --fatal-infos
dart test --branch-coverage --coverage=.dart_tool/coverage
dart run coverage:format_coverage --lcov --in=.dart_tool/coverage \
  --out=.dart_tool/lcov.info --report-on=bin --report-on=lib
```

The PHP helper runs on the system PHP with Xdebug
([decision 0013](../../docs/decisions/0013-php-profile.md#runtime)).
`./quality bootstrap` installs the pinned Composer and caches the packages of
the helper's `composer.lock` in `~/.cache/quality/composer`. The native
commands run from `helpers/php` with
`COMPOSER_CACHE_DIR=~/.cache/quality/composer`; PHP CS Fixer takes one path
per run when no configuration file is given:

```sh
COMPOSER_DISABLE_NETWORK=1 php ~/.cache/quality/toolchains/composer-2.10.3/composer \
  install --no-scripts --no-plugins --no-progress
for path in bin src tests; do
  php vendor/bin/php-cs-fixer check --rules=@PER-CS --using-cache=no "$path"
done
php -d memory_limit=1G vendor/bin/phpstan analyse --level=max --no-progress bin src tests
XDEBUG_MODE=coverage php -d zend_extension=xdebug vendor/bin/phpunit \
  --bootstrap vendor/autoload.php --coverage-filter bin --coverage-filter src \
  --branch-coverage --disable-coverage-ignore --coverage-text tests
```

After changing a policy or scenario manifest model, regenerate both committed
schemas from the repository root:

```sh
./quality policy schema --write
```

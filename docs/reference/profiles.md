# Profile support matrix

A component's `profile` in [`quality.toml`](../../quality.toml) selects the
native tools that check it. `./quality component add` detects the profile
from the manifest at the component root. The pinned versions are in
[`toolchains.toml`](../../tools/quality/toolchains.toml) and
[decision 0001](../decisions/0001-toolchain-pins.md).

## Tier 1 profiles

| | Python | TypeScript | Dart | PHP |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Decision | [0009](../decisions/0009-python-profile.md) | [0011](../decisions/0011-typescript-profile.md) | [0012](../decisions/0012-dart-profile.md) | [0013](../decisions/0013-php-profile.md) |
| Manifest | `pyproject.toml` | `package.json` | `pubspec.yaml` | `composer.json` |
| Lockfile | `uv.lock` | `package-lock.json`, or a workspace root's | `pubspec.lock`, or a pub workspace root's | `composer.lock` |
| Sources (`component add` default) | `src` | `src` | `lib`, and `bin` when present | `src` |
| Unit tests (default) | `tests` | `tests` | `test` | `tests` |
| Formatting | Ruff | Prettier | `dart format` | PHP CS Fixer, `@PER-CS` |
| Lint | Ruff | ESLint with typescript-eslint | `dart analyze` with package:lints | PHPStan |
| Types | Pyright, strict | `tsc` | `dart analyze`, strict modes | PHPStan, level max |
| Tests | pytest | Vitest | package:test | PHPUnit |
| Coverage report | coverage.py JSON | LCOV from V8 | LCOV from package:coverage | Clover and JSONL from php-code-coverage |
| Branch coverage | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes, with Xdebug |
| Structure and imports | Core, from the Python AST | Node helper | Dart helper | PHP helper |
| Installed by bootstrap | uv environment of the component | Node and the locked npm packages | Dart SDK and the locked pub packages | Composer and the locked packages |
| System requirement | None | None | None | PHP and Xdebug at the minor versions in `[runtimes]` |

The tools the core itself needs (uv, CPython, gitleaks, actionlint, and
osv-scanner) are installed for every repository. A profile's toolchain is
installed only when a component uses that profile, or when a candidate
changes the profile's helper bundle in `tools/quality/helpers`. The
prerequisites are in [decision 0002](../decisions/0002-installation-strategy.md).

## Unsupported source

Source files are classified by extension and owner
([decision 0006](../decisions/0006-discovery-and-classification.md)). A
source file of another language inside a component fails with
`discovery.language-mismatch`, and a source language that no profile
supports, such as Go or Ruby, fails with `discovery.unsupported-language`.
Neither passes silently, and both name the file. Unsupported variants of a
supported language also fail: Flutter and web Dart packages, and JavaScript
sources in a TypeScript component.

The browser target of the TypeScript profile, `target = "browser"`, covers
single-page React + Vite applications
([decision 0017](../decisions/0017-browser-frontend-profile.md)). Every check
runs its static checks: the React Hooks and accessibility lint rules, import
boundaries, Stylelint and Prettier for CSS, and the HTML entry points. Its
unit suites run in jsdom with the base coverage floors. The merge stage builds
the candidate for production, serves the build, and runs the end-to-end
suites in the pinned Chromium in every declared viewport, with console,
request, and accessibility evidence
([decision 0018](../decisions/0018-browser-builds-and-scenarios.md)).
Bootstrap installs that Chromium for an active browser component, and
bootstrap and doctor report whether it starts and matches the locked
Playwright; it needs system libraries such as NSS and GLib, and
`typescript.browser-libraries` names the missing ones. CI checks browser
components in a lane of the gate of their own, `quality gate --lane
browser`, which the aggregate status requires like the main lane.

## Several components

A repository may hold any mix of profiles, and several components of the
same profile. Each component has its own root, manifest, and lockfile, and
the thresholds of the shared policy; no two components may share a root or
overlapping source and test directories. Coverage floors and scenario
manifests apply per component.

## Adding a profile

A new language or coverage format is a change to the core, described in the
[extension guide](../guides/extending.md). The profile contract tests in
`tools/quality/tests/unit/test_profile_contract.py` fail until every stage
knows the new profile.

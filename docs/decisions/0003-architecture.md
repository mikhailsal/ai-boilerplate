# 0003 Architecture and configuration layout

Status: accepted (P00); launcher path amended in P05, adapter layout in P06,
CI wrappers and reports in P10.

## Repository layout

| Path | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `quality` | Symlink to the stdlib launcher `tools/quality/launcher/src/quality_launcher.py` ([decision 0010](0010-launcher-bootstrap-and-hooks.md)) |
| `quality.toml` | The single policy source: thresholds, components, classification, exceptions |
| `tools/quality/` | The always-required Python tooling core (`pyproject.toml`, `uv.lock`) |
| `tools/quality/src/quality/` | Core package |
| `tools/quality/tests/unit/` | Core unit suite (shipped with the template) |
| `tools/quality/tests/acceptance/` | Maintainer acceptance harness (not exported) |
| `tools/quality/launcher/` | The launcher component: stdlib source, tests, and its own lockfile |
| `tools/quality/helpers/{typescript,dart,php}/` | Native helper bundles, each a native project with its own lockfile and tests |
| `tools/quality/toolchains.toml` | Toolchain pins and checksums |
| `docs/` | Documentation, decisions, plan records |
| `.github/workflows/`, `ci/gitlab/` | Thin CI wrappers ([decision 0015](0015-ci-wrappers-and-merge-gates.md)) |
| `.github/CODEOWNERS`, `.github/rulesets/` | Owners of the control files and the prepared branch ruleset |

The core does not own the repository root: application components may use the
root `pyproject.toml`, `package.json`, `pubspec.yaml`, or `composer.json`.

## Core boundaries

Each subpackage has one responsibility. Dependencies point downwards only and
are enforced on the core by the declared-module architecture rule:

1. `diagnostics` – diagnostic model, rule registry, rendering, exit codes.
   `strictjson` below it parses JSON with a nesting bound that holds on every
   machine, because the standard decoder's limit follows the C stack.
2. `process` – subprocess execution with argument arrays, explicit working
   directory, sanitized environment, timeouts, bounded output, and process
   group cleanup on timeout or interruption.
3. `policy` – pydantic models (`extra="forbid"`), loading, cross-validation,
   JSON Schema export.
4. `gitio` – Git plumbing, candidate identity, snapshot materialization, diff
   and revision mapping.
5. `discovery` – file classification, component ownership, role activation.
6. `metrics`, `coverage`, `testing` – normalized models and native report
   parsers; no subprocess calls. `reports` sits above `coverage` and
   `testing` and exports their results as JUnit, LCOV, and Cobertura.
7. `adapters` – one package per language profile, plus modules the profiles
   share (configuration readers and static-check targets); they call native
   tools through `process` and return normalized results. The profile packages
   do not import each other.
8. `rules` – common repository, documentation, secret, blob, exception,
   structure, and architecture rules over normalized data.
9. `scenarios`, `ci`, `toolchain`, `hooks` – feature modules; `ci` holds the
   workflow, CODEOWNERS, control-file, and job-result rules.
10. `engine` and `cli` – orchestration and argument parsing only.

Lower layers never import higher layers; cycles are errors.

## Language adapters

An adapter implements one protocol: inventory (which files it owns), format
check, lint, type check, structure metrics and imports (via the core Python
`ast` module or the native helper), unit/integration test execution with
coverage, safe fixes, and doctor probes. Adapters reuse native tools; the core
never parses a language itself except Python via the standard `ast` module.

## Roles and activation

Every component is declared in `quality.toml` with `role`:

- `application` – the project's own code; activates its profile toolchain.
- `tooling` – the Python core; always active.
- `helper` – a native helper bundle. It is active when an application
  component uses its profile, when the candidate changes any of its files, or
  when `repository.mode = "maintainer"` (this repository).

Discovery reports manifests outside declared components and source files
outside declared roots as errors, so helper manifests and fixtures never
activate an unrelated profile by accident.

## Policy layout

`quality.toml` holds `schema_version`, `[repository]`, `[thresholds]`,
`[coverage]`, `[[components]]` (root, profile, role, source and test roots,
capabilities, modules, scenarios file), `[[classification]]`, and
`[[exceptions]]`. Native tool configurations that need policy values (Pyright
strictness, coverage source lists) are generated into the snapshot at run time
or checked for consistency; thresholds are never duplicated in native configs.

## Diagnostics and exit codes

Every finding has a stable rule ID, severity, repository-relative location,
message, and corrective hint; `quality explain <rule-id>` prints the
requirement. Exit codes: `0` pass, `1` gate violations, `2` usage or policy
error, `3` environment or tool error, `4` internal error.

## Non-goals

No package manager, build system, general-purpose parser, test framework,
result cache, or hosted service is implemented.

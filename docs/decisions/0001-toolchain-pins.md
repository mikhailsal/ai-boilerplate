# 0001 Toolchain pins

Status: accepted (P00, 2026-10-20). Versions were read from the primary
registries on that date; checksums were verified against vendor checksum files.
Since P03 the machine-readable source of truth for downloaded standalone tools
is `tools/quality/toolchains.toml` (uv, gitleaks and its rule set, osv-scanner,
actionlint); profile runtimes join it with their phases. Since P06 it also
pins Node.js and, under `[packages.npm]`, the npm packages every TypeScript
component must lock ([decision 0011](0011-typescript-profile.md)). This record
explains the choices.
